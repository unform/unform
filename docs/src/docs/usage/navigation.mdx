title: Navigation
---

To create a navigation file, simple add it under the config folder. Example:

```yml title=sidebar.yml
# Just a simple item
- label: 'Home'
  link: '/'
# With a list of subitens
- label: 'With subitens'
  items:
    - label: 'My Example'
      link: '/my-example'
```

You can also add external links:

```yml
- label: 'GitHub'
  link: 'https://github.com/jpedroschmitz'
```
