## Overview

Unform is a performance focused library that helps you creating beautiful forms in React with the power of uncontrolled components performance and React Hooks.

## Main advantages

- Beautiful syntax;
- React Hooks 😍;
- Performance focused;
- Use of uncontrolled components;
- Integration with pickers, dropdowns and other libraries;

## Why not Formik, Redux Form or another library?

Formik/Redux Form has a really great syntax while it has a really poor support to uncontrolled components and deep nested data structures. With unform it's easy to create forms with complex relationships without loosing performance.
